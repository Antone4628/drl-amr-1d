"""Utility functions for exact solutions and error calculations.

This module provides exact analytical solutions for various initial conditions
(wave equation test cases) and error metrics for comparing numerical solutions
against exact solutions.

Key Functions:
    exact_solution: Compute exact solution for any icase at position (x, t).
    eff: Compute forcing/effective function for AMR refinement indicators.
    calculate_grid_normalized_l2_error: Compute mesh-independent L2 error metric.

Note:
    The exact solutions assume periodic boundary conditions on [-1, 1] with
    wave speed u = 2.0. Solutions are computed as q(x, t) = f(x - u*t).

def exact_solution(coord, npoin, time, icase, k=5, omega=np.pi):

    Evaluates q(x, t) = f((x - u*t) mod L) where f is determined by icase

    Args:
        coord: Spatial coordinates, shape (npoin,). Values in [-1, 1].
        npoin: Number of points. Must match len(coord).

            - 1: Gaussian pulse (always positive)
            - 2: Square pulse
            - 3: Diffusing Gaussian
            - 7: Tanh profile
            - 8: Sine wave

        Models trained only on icase=1 may learn spurious correlations
        (refining where q > 0) since Gaussian is always positive. Test
        on cases with negative values (10, 12, 16) to detect this.
