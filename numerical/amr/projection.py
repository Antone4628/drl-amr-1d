"""Projection operators for h-adaptive mesh refinement.

This module creates scatter and gather matrices for projecting DG solutions
between parent and child elements during mesh adaptation. The projection
preserves polynomial solutions exactly up to the DG polynomial order.

Key Functions:
    projections: Main entry point — creates all scatter/gather matrices.
    create_S_matrix: Build integration matrices for parent-child projection.
    create_scatters: Build scatter operators (parent → two children).
    create_gathers: Build gather operators (two children → parent).

Mathematical Background:
    When refining an element, the parent solution must be "scattered" to two
    child elements. This is done via L2 projection:
    
        u_child = M⁻¹ S u_parent
    
    where M is the mass matrix and S is the projection integral matrix.
    
    For coarsening, two child solutions are "gathered" to form the parent:
    
        u_parent = 0.5 * M⁻¹ (S1ᵀ u_child1 + S2ᵀ u_child2)
    
    The 0.5 factor accounts for the domain size change (each child covers
    half the parent's domain in reference coordinates).

Note:
    All matrices operate on the reference element [-1, 1]. Child 1 maps to
    [-1, 0] and child 2 maps to [0, 1] in the parent's reference space.
