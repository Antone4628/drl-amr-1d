"""Mesh adaptation routines for Adaptive Mesh Refinement.

This module provides functions for marking elements for refinement/coarsening,
adapting the mesh structure, and projecting the solution between meshes.

Key Functions:
    mark: Mark elements for refinement or coarsening based on solution.
    adapt_mesh: Perform mesh refinement/coarsening based on marks.
    adapt_sol: Project solution to adapted mesh using scatter/gather.
    check_balance: Verify mesh satisfies 2:1 balance constraint.
    enforce_balance: Iteratively refine to restore 2:1 balance.

Note:
    The 2:1 balance constraint requires that neighboring elements differ
    by at most one refinement level. This prevents excessive jumps in
    resolution across element boundaries.

# ==================== Single-Element AMR Primitives ====================
#
# These functions perform individual refine/coarsen operations on the
# mesh topology and solution vector. They are the atomic building blocks
# used by:
#   - adapt_mesh() / adapt_sol() for batch operations (marks array)
#   - solver.refine_element() / solver.coarsen_element() for RL actions
#
# Design: stateless free functions. They take arrays, return modified
# arrays. No solver reference, no marks array, no side effects beyond
# the returned values. label_mat is read-only (forest pre-computes all
# possible elements).

    """Project solution onto adapted mesh using scatter/gather operations.
    
    Delegates projection operations to project_refine_single() and
    project_coarsen_single() primitives. This function handles the
    marks-based iteration and solution array assembly.
    
    Args:
        q: Current solution values, shape (npoin_dg,).
        coord: Current node coordinates (unused, kept for API compatibility).
        marks: Adaptation markers, shape (n_active,).
            -1 = coarsen, 0 = no change, 1 = refine.
        active: Active element IDs before adaptation (1-indexed), shape (n_active,).
        label_mat: Element relationships from forest(), shape (total_elements, 5).
        PS1, PS2: Scatter matrices for children 1 and 2, shape (ngl, ngl).
        PG1, PG2: Gather matrices for children 1 and 2, shape (ngl, ngl).
        ngl: Number of LGL nodes per element.
        
    Returns:
        Adapted solution values, shape (new_npoin_dg,).
    
    Note:
        The `active` array must correspond to the pre-adaptation mesh
        (same ordering as `marks`), not the post-adaptation mesh.
