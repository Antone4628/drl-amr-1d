"""Discontinuous Galerkin matrix construction utilities.

This module provides functions for constructing the matrices needed in the
Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization of the 1D advection equation:

    ∂u/∂t + c * ∂u/∂x = 0

where c is the wave speed (advection velocity).

The DG method represents the solution as piecewise polynomials within each
element, using Lagrange interpolation at Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) points.
The discretization produces a system:

    M * du/dt = -D * u + F * u

where:
    M: Mass matrix (local integration of basis functions)
    D: Differentiation/stiffness matrix (volume integral of derivatives)
    F: Flux matrix (inter-element coupling via numerical flux)

Key Components:
    create_mass_matrix: Element-wise mass matrices for time integration.
    create_diff_matrix: Element differentiation matrix for spatial derivatives.
    Fmatrix_upwind_flux: Upwind numerical flux for advection stability.
    Matrix_DSS: Direct stiffness summation for global matrix assembly.

Mathematical Background:
    The weak form of the DG method on element e is:
    
    ∫_e φ_i * ∂u/∂t dx = -∫_e φ_i * c * ∂u/∂x dx + [φ_i * c * u*]|_∂e
    
    where φ_i are test functions and u* is the numerical flux at interfaces.
    The upwind flux for positive c is: u* = u^- (value from upwind element).

Note:
    All matrices use 0-based indexing consistent with NumPy conventions.
    Quadrature is performed using LGL points for diagonal mass matrices.

    Returns:
        Rusanov flux matrix, shape (npoin, npoin).
    
    Note:
        The Rusanov flux is:
        - More dissipative than pure upwind for linear problems
        - Useful for nonlinear problems where characteristics vary
        - Reduces to upwind for scalar linear advection
        
        For the linear advection equation, pure upwind is typically preferred
        as it provides optimal dissipation.
    
    See Also:
        Fmatrix_upwind_flux: Less dissipative for linear advection.
        Fmatrix_centered_flux: Zero dissipation (may be unstable).

    """Assemble global matrices via Direct Stiffness Summation.
    
    Combines element-level mass and differentiation matrices into global
    system matrices by summing contributions at shared nodes. This is the
    standard finite element assembly process.
    
    For continuous Galerkin (CG), shared nodes are truly shared and
    contributions add directly. For DG, the periodicity array handles
    the coupling at periodic boundaries.
    
    The assembled system is:
    
        M * du/dt = -D * u + F * u
    
    where M and D come from this function and F from the flux matrices.
    
    Args:
        Me: Element mass matrices, shape (nelem, ngl, ngl).
            Me[e] is the mass matrix for element e.
        De: Element differentiation matrix, shape (ngl, ngl).
            Same for all elements (reference element matrix).
        u: Wave speed (for scaling the differentiation matrix).
        intma: Element-node connectivity, shape (ngl, nelem).
            intma[i, e] = global index of local node i in element e.
        periodicity: Periodic boundary mapping, shape (npoin,).
            periodicity[I] = J means node I maps to node J for assembly.
            For interior nodes: periodicity[I] = I (identity).
            For periodic pairs: periodicity[I_right] = I_left.
        ngl: Number of LGL points per element.
        nelem: Number of elements.
        npoin: Number of global points (after applying periodicity).
    
    Returns:
        M: Global mass matrix, shape (npoin, npoin).
        D: Global differentiation matrix (scaled by u), shape (npoin, npoin).
    
    Note:
        The periodicity array implements periodic boundary conditions by
        mapping the rightmost node to the leftmost node, effectively making
        them the same degree of freedom.

        >>> M, D = Matrix_DSS(Me, De, wave_speed, intma, periodicity, ngl, nelem, npoin)
        >>> # Verify mass matrix properties
        >>> np.allclose(M, M.T)  # Symmetric
        True
        >>> np.all(np.linalg.eigvals(M) > 0)  # Positive definite
        True
